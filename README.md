Team Project with Joseph Larson

This is BlackJack program.  It is you the player versus the computer and you must try to get as close to 21 as you can
without going over by hitting (getting another card) or staying (not getting another card).  When you have decided to
stay, the computer will have a chance to try to get to 21.  The computer must stay on 17 or higher.  Whoever has the
highest amount of cards (less than 21) will win-- dealer wins ties.
